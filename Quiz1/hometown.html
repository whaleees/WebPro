                <div class="history">
                    <p>Makassar, historically known as Ujung Pandang, has long been a center of political and economic power in Indonesia. As early as the 14th century, it served as the capital of the Gowa Sultanate, which was one of the most powerful kingdoms in eastern Indonesia. The city’s strategic location on the southwest coast of Sulawesi turned it into a thriving port, connecting traders from the Malay Peninsula, the Middle East, China, and Europe through a bustling spice trade network.</p>

                    <p>In the 17th century, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) gained control of Makassar after the signing of the Treaty of Bongaya, which led to the decline of the Gowa Sultanate. This era marked the beginning of Makassar’s colonial period, during which the Dutch used the city as a strategic point in their expansion into the Indonesian archipelago.</p>

                    <p>During World War II, Makassar was occupied by Japanese forces, which led to significant changes in the city’s infrastructure and economy. After Indonesia gained its independence from the Dutch in 1945, Makassar played a key role in the country’s national development. The city was officially renamed Makassar in 1971, reverting to its historical name after being known as Ujung Pandang during the colonial period.</p>

                    <p>Today, Makassar continues to serve as a critical port city and a gateway to eastern Indonesia. Its rich historical legacy, combined with its modern development, makes it an important cultural and economic hub in the region.</p>
