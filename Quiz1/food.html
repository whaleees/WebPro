                Coto Makassar, often simply referred to as "Coto," is a traditional soup from Makassar, South Sulawesi. This rich and savory dish is made from a blend of beef and various offals like heart, lungs, and intestines, simmered in a spice-infused broth. Key ingredients include garlic, shallots, ginger, galangal, and lemongrass, which give it a distinctive flavor. Coto is typically enjoyed with steamed rice or burasa, a type of compressed rice cake, and often accompanied by a spicy sambal tauco.
